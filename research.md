## Research

My research broadly lies in stochastic analysis and optimal transport, with a particular focus on mathematical finance and mode
l uncertainty.

### Focus areas
- Adapted (causal) optimal transport and its applications
- Robust frameworks for high-noise, low-signal environments

### Updates
More detailed project and publication information will be shared soon.
