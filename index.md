## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in **Mathematics** at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Martin Larsson](https://sites.google.com/view/martin-larsson)  and [Johannes Wiesel](https://sites.google.com/view/johannes-wiesel). In August 2026, I will join ETH Zurich as a postdoctoral researcher. Before starting my PhD, I earned a Master's degree in Mathematics and a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Mathematics (double major) at Seoul National University.


My research lies in **optimal transport** and **stochastic analysis**, with broader interests in applications to **mathematical finance** and related fields. I am particularly interested in robust formulations for high-noise, low-signal environments, where model uncertainty and misspecification are prevalent. During my PhD, I have primarily focused on developing the theory of **adapted (causal) optimal transport**.
