## About Me

Hi, I am a PhD candidate in Mathematics at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Martin Larsson](https://sites.google.com/view/martin-larsson)  and [Johannes Wiesel](https://sites.google.com/view/johannes-wiesel). Before starting my PhD, I earned a Master’s degree in Mathematics and a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and Mathematics (double major) at Seoul National University.


My research broadly lies in stochastic analysis and optimal transport, with a particular focus on applications in mathematical finance and related areas. I am especially interested in developing theoretical frameworks that remain robust in high-noise, low-signal environments where model uncertainty and misspecification are prevalent.


During my PhD, I have primarily focused on developing the theory of adapted (causal) optimal transport. 

I will be on the **2025-2026** job market.
