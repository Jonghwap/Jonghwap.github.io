## About Me

Hi, I am currently a PhD candidate in Mathematics at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Martin Larsson](https://sites.google.com/view/martin-larsson)  and [Johannes Wiesel](https://sites.google.com/view/johannes-wiesel). In August 2026, I will join ETH Zurich as a postdoctoral researcher. Before starting my PhD, I earned a Master's degree in Mathematics and a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Mathematics (double major) at Seoul National University.

My research lies in **optimal transport**, **stochastic analysis** and their applications to **mathematical finance** and related fields. I am particularly interested in robust formulations for high-noise, low-signal environments, where model uncertainty and misspecification are prevalent. 

During my PhD, I have primarily focused on developing the theory of adapted (causal) optimal transport.
