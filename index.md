## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in Mathematics at Carnegie Mellon University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Martion Larsson](https://sites.google.com/view/martin-larsson) and [Johannes Wiesel](https://sites.google.com/view/johannes-wiesel). Before starting my PhD, I earned a Master’s degree in Mathematics and a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and Mathematics (double major) at Seoul National University.

## Research Interest

My research broadly lies in stochastic analysis and optimal transport, with a particular focus on applications in mathematical finance and related areas. I am especially interested in developing theoretical frameworks that remain robust in high-noise, low-signal environments where model uncertainty and misspecification are prevalent. 

During my PhD, I have primarily focused on developing the theory of adapted (causal) optimal transport. 

I will be on the **2025-2026** job market.
