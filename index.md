## About Me

Hi, I am a **math** PhD candidate at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Martin Larsson](https://sites.google.com/view/martin-larsson)  and [Johannes Wiesel](https://sites.google.com/view/johannes-wiesel). Before starting my PhD, I earned a Master's degree in Mathematics and a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Mathematics (double major) at Seoul National University.


My research lies in **optimal transport** and **stochastic analysis**, with broader interests in applications to **mathematical finance** and related fields. I am interested in robust formulations of high-noise, low-signal environments, in which model uncertainty and misspecification are prevalent.

During my PhD, I have primarily focused on developing the theory of **adapted (causal) optimal transport**. 

I will be on the **2025-2026** job market.
