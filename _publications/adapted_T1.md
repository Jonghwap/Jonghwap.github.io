  The $T_1$ inequality, which bounds the 1-Wasserstein distance in terms of the relative entropy, is known to characterize Gaussian concentration. To extend the $T_1$ inequality to laws of discrete-time processes while preserving their temporal structure, we investigate the adapted $T_1$ inequality which relates the 1-adapted Wasserstein distance to the relative entropy. We prove that $\mu$ satisfies the adapted $T_1$ inequality if and only if $\mu$ is subgaussian.
