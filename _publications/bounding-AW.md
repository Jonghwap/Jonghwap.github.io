  While the topological differences between the adapted Wasserstein distance $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{W}_p$ and the Wasserstein distance $\mathcal{W}_p$ are well understood, their differences as metrics remain largely unexplored beyond the trivial bound $\mathcal{W}_p\lesssim \mathcal{A}\mathcal{W}_p$. This paper closes this gap by providing upper bounds of $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{W}_p$ in terms of $\mathcal{W}_p$ through investigation of the smooth adapted Wasserstein distance. Our upper bounds are explicit and are given by a sum of $\mathcal{W}_p$, Eder's modulus of continuity and a term characterizing the tail behavior of measures. As a consequence, upper bounds on $\mathcal{W}_p$ automatically hold for $\mathcal{AW}_p$ under mild regularity assumptions on the measures considered. A particular instance of our findings is the inequality $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{W}_1\le C\sqrt{\mathcal{W}_1}$ on the set of measures that have Lipschitz kernels.

  Our work also reveals how smoothing of measures affects the adapted weak topology. In fact, we find that the topology induced by the smooth adapted Wasserstein distance exhibits a non-trivial interpolation property, which we characterize explicitly: it lies in between the adapted weak topology and the weak topology, and the inclusion is governed by the decay of the smoothing parameter.
